1) What are JDK, JRE and JVM?
	1.1) JDK is the Java Development Kit that holds the necessary components for you to create Java programs.
	1.2) JRE is the Java Runtime Environment that is the component on your machine that creates the JVM.
	1.3) JVM is the Java Virtual Machine that allows programs to run on any device ("Write once, run anywhere").
2) What is the relation between the three (JDK, JRE, JVM)? How is Java code executed in a Java program. Explain by assuming that the program was written on one platform (e.g., Windows) and executed on another (e.g., Linux).
	2.1)
3) With the help of the code for Hello World program in Java (you can copy code with citation), explain when this program needs JDK (and not JRE and JVM), JRE (and not JVM) and JVM.
	3.1) Hello World example: (Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/beginning-java-programming-with-hello-world-example/)
		/* This is a simple Java program. 
   		   FileName : "HelloWorld.java". */
		class HelloWorld 
		{ 
		    // Your program begins with a call to main(). 
		    // Prints "Hello, World" to the terminal window. 
		    public static void main(String args[]) 
		    { 
		        System.out.println("Hello, World"); 
		    } 
		} 
	3.2)
4) Non-trivial question:
	4.1) If these 3 commonly work together, why are they not integrated into one standalone package?
	4.2)
